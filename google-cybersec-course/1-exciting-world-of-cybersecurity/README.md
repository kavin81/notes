## what is cybersecurity?

- the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access / criminal exploitation.


## advantages of cybersecurity

- security protests against external and internal threats
    - threat actors
        - any person / group who presents a security risk
    - internal threat - ex / current employees , vendors , clients
        - mostly accidental
    - external threat - outside groups / persons
        - with intention


- improved overall org productivity
    - mitigate / reduce impact of threats

- ensure compliance with local laws
    - avoids fines

- maintain brand trust
    - loss of brand trust can hurt company revenues in long term

## functions of security analyst

- protecting computer & network systems.
    - monitor org internal network
        - if a threat is detected , analyst is first to respond
    - prevent threats from taking place
        - take part in pentesting
            - goal is to identify vulnerabilities
        - install preventing software
            - eg: antivirus , network filters
        - often work with developers to support prod sec
            - via appropiate procs & systems

## what are security audits?

- review of org security records , activities & other related docs.
    - eg: making sure api keys are only known to certain people and not all employees
- they must occur in periodic intervals


## parts of entry-level security pros

- operations side
    - responding to detections and doing investigations
- project side
    - new / improved detections (working w/ other teams)

## what are playbooks?

- list of how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents

| Internal threat      | A current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. An internal threat can be accidental, such as an employee clicking on a malicious email link, or intentional, such as unauthorized data access.                 |
| Network security     | The practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access, including data, services, systems, and devices stored in the network.                                                                                           |

## importance of cybersecurity

- org business countinuty and ethical standing
    - legal & moral implications incase of org security breach

- data leaks can effect orgs reputation and/or the reputation of the client/customer/user

- personally identifiable information (PII)
    - used to infer persons identity
    - eg: full name, DOB, physical address, phone no, email, IP.

    - Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII)
        - subtype of PII that falls under stricter guidelines
        - eg: [SSN](## "Social security no") , medical / financial info & [biometric data](## "fingerprints/ facial recognition")

    - threat actors will look for SPII and PII if an org is breached , the main concern is identity theft
